Python Projects using the Pandas Library
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
Using the python Pandas Library, I've created mini projects. These projects include data cleaning, building dataframes and series, and data manipulation.
This will send you to my GitHub repository where you can exploar these projects
